# Creatibot

[Result](https://philipgher.github.io/creatibot/)

This is an exhibition screen to display creative capabilities of computers. The texts, images and music are generated by neural networks. If you think your creative job is safe, watch out, computers are taking over. But what are these outputs really worth? Is it truly creative? And what is the role of the maker in this process? A curator, input-designer maybe?
